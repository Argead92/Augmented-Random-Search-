Reinforcement learning using Augmented Random Search - Python

This is a Python implementation of the Augmented Random Search alghorithm as described by Horia Mania, Aurelia Guy and Benjamin Recht in "Simple random search provides a competitive approach to reinforcement learning"(2018).

The paper describes two versions of the alghorithm, this is the implementation of the second version in which states encountered during a policy are normalized by an online computed mean and standard deviation.
